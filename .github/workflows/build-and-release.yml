          ## Downloads

          - **WakFocus.exe** (Framework-dependent) - Requires .NET 8.0 Runtime
          - **WakFocus.exe** (Self-contained) - No runtime required, larger file size

          ## Security

          - âœ… Built automatically by GitHub Actions
          - âœ… SHA256 checksums provided (see checksums.txt)
          - âœ… Source code scanned with CodeQL
